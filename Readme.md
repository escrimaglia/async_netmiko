# Async Netmiko Test

## IaC - Infrastructure as Code

It refers to the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (such as servers, networks, and databases) through code and automation rather than through manual processes. This allows infrastructure to be treated the same way as application code, enabling it to be versioned, tested, and deployed using software development practices.

### Network Automation

As part of IaC, Network Automation refers to the use of software to automatically manage, configure, test, deploy, and operate network devices and services. It replaces manual tasks with programmatic workflows and scripts, reducing human intervention, minimizing errors, and increasing efficiency in network management.

This approach is increasingly important in modern networking, especially in large-scale environments such as cloud infrastructures, data centers, and enterprise networks.

### Async Netmiko

Async Netmiko is a repository that contains tests I have conducted to differentiate the performance between running Netmiko synchronously versus asynchronously.

The outputs directory contains the results of each test, and as can be observed, the results are notably different.

To conduct the test, I utilized the EVE-NG Pro simulator hosted on Google Cloud, setting up a lab environment with five Cisco IOS devices.

#### Sync, Async Multi-Thread and Non-Blocking Async

- Sync Mode: Tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other. Each task must complete before the next one starts. The program waits for a task to finish before moving on.
- Async Multi-Thread Mode: Involves creating multiple threads within a process. Threads can run concurrently, sharing memory and resources. Python threads are managed by the OS, but the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) restricts true parallel execution of Python in a single process at a time.
- Non-Blocking Async Mode: Uses an event loop to manage tasks cooperatively in a single thread. Tasks voluntarily yield control using await during I/O or other non-blocking operations. No threads are created; instead, the event loop interleaves tasks during await points and GIL is not an issue.
- Python 3.12 has improved performance for the GIL and threading, but the fundamental limitations of the GIL remain.

### Running as script

> [!NOTE]
> To connect to the devices, I configured SSH Bastion Host on my Mac.

From your CLI execute the following:

- `python3 sync_serv.py` demonstrates synchronous operations.
- `python3 async_serv.py` demonstrates asynchronous multi-thread operations.
- `python3 nb_async_serv.py` demonstrates non-blocking asynchronous operations.

#### SSH JumpHost configuration

In my case, to access devices in the Cloud EVE-NG simulator, I configured an SSH Bastion Host. Below is the JumpHost configuration, which might also be useful for others.

```
host jumphost  
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa  
  IdentitiesOnly yes  
  user xxxx  
  hostname xxxx.octupus.com  

host 10.2.0.* !jumphost  
  ProxyCommand ssh -F ~/.ssh/config -W %h:%p jumphost  

host 10.2.0.*  
  KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1  
  Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc  
  HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss
  ```

### Running as an API endpoint

I configured a FastAPI project with two endpoints:

- `/api/v1/netmiko/async` demonstrates asynchronous multi-thread operations.
- `/api/v1/netmiko/nb-async` demonstrates non-blocking asynchronous operations.
- `/api/v1/netmiko/sync` demonstrates synchronous operations.

To launch the application, execute the following command in your CLI:

- `uvicorn controller:app --reload`
- `localhost:8000/docs`

This project demonstrates how to integrate asynchronous Netmiko operations within an HTTP server using FastAPI. The uvicorn server is utilized as it supports both synchronous and asynchronous programming, showcasing FastAPIâ€™s flexibility for network automation tasks.

### Ansible and Netmiko

I have also added tests with Ansible to observe the behavior of Netmiko running as an `Ansible Module`. In addition to demonstrating how an ansible module is built, I thought it was worthwhile to conduct these tests since the results show how Ansible handles concurrency. Therefore, whether Netmiko runs synchronously or asynchronously becomes irrelevant.

Why would one run Netmiko as an `ansible module` when there are so many modules available in the community? In most cases, you can probably find an existing module that fits your needs. However, I have personally had to create my own modules to automate older devices, such as Siemens industrial equipment or Cisco Systems' legacy yet still operational Wireless LAN Controllers.

As mentioned earlier, `Ansible manages concurrency (forks)`, as demonstrated by the test results.

In the Ansible folder, you will find a playbook and two Ansible modules that can be swapped when executing the playbook (and check the differences). The modules are located in a subdirectory called `library`, as this is the simplest way for Ansible to locate the modules without requiring changes to its configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> To get the execution time of a playbook, enable the callback Timer in the `ansible.cfg`
> 
> ```ini
> callbacks_enabled = timer
> ```

For my playbook there is aprox 10 seconds it's takes to Ansible to executes the other tasks.

### Results

#### Test time for five devices and two commands per device

Sync netmiko: `{'result': 'Tiempo total: 0:00:29.834032'}`  
Async Multi-Thread netmiko: `{'result': 'Tiempo total: 0:00:06.886019'}`  
Non-Blocking Async netmiko: `{'result': 'Tiempo total: 0:00:07.685438'}`  
Ansible with sync_netmiko ansible mudule: `Playbook run took 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 19 seconds`  
Ansible with async_netmiko ansible module: `Playbook run took 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 19 seconds`

Hope this helps in your automation journey
